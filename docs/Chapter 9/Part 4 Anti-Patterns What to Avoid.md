## Anti-Patterns: What to Avoid

Finally, it's crucial to recognize and avoid common traps.

*   **The "Magic Wand" Fallacy:** Don't treat the AI as a magic wand. Vague specs like "Build me a social media site" will produce vague, useless results. The quality of the output is a direct function of the quality of the input.
*   **Blind Trust:** Never, ever merge AI-generated code without a thorough human review. The AI is a brilliant junior developer, but it can make mistakes, miss security vulnerabilities, or write inefficient code. The human is the senior developer, and their stamp of approval is required.
*   **Ignoring a "Bad Feeling":** If the AI generates code that seems overly complex, hard to understand, or just "feels wrong," don't ignore that intuition. Ask the AI to explain its reasoning. "Why did you choose to use a recursive function here instead of a simple loop?" Often, questioning the output will lead you to a simpler, better solution.
*   **Spec-Only Development:** Don't let the spec become an ivory tower. The developer's expertise is still needed to ensure the spec is grounded in technical reality. A feedback loop where developers can easily push back on and refine specs is essential.

By embracing these advanced strategies and remaining vigilant against anti-patterns, you can scale the benefits of AI/Spec-Driven Development from small projects to large, complex, and long-lived software systems.
