Software is changing faster than we can keep up, and the old way of building it just can’t handle the chaos anymore. AI isn’t just a helper now, it’s becoming the bridge between ideas and working code. This book is your guide to that new world. Here, specs become the source of truth, AI becomes your tireless teammate, and you become the architect shaping everything. If you’ve ever wished building software felt lighter, clearer, and actually fun… welcome.
