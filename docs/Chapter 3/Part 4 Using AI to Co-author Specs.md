## Using AI to Co-author Specs

The process of writing a spec is not a solo activity. You can and should use AI as a partner to help you think through the problem.

*   **Brainstorming Edge Cases:** "AI, I'm writing a spec for a file upload feature. What are the common edge cases I need to consider?" The AI might respond with things like: file size limits, unsupported file types, network interruptions, concurrent uploads, and insufficient disk space.
*   **Generating Data Structures:** "AI, I need a JSON structure to represent a blog post. It should include a title, author, content, publication date, and a list of tags."
*   **Clarifying Ambiguity:** "AI, my spec says 'the user should be logged in.' What are the different ways a user's login state can be verified in a typical web application?"

By using the AI as a Socratic partner, you can harden your specification against ambiguity before it ever gets translated into code. This proactive clarification is infinitely cheaper than reactive debugging later in the process. The time spent meticulously crafting a high-quality specification will be repaid tenfold in the speed and accuracy of the code generation that follows.
